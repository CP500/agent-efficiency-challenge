# Business-Ready AI Agent Challenge

Welcome to the Business-Ready AI Agent Challenge! This competition emphasizes the development of secure, efficient AI agents tailored for business applications. Participants will tackle two challenges: a repetitive task and a one-off task, highlighting the capability of AI agents to handle business scenarios securely and swiftly.

## Objective

The primary objective of this competition is to develop AI agents suitable for business environments, prioritizing security, speed, and efficiency. Participants will demonstrate the ability to create agents capable of securely completing tasks while maintaining high performance.

## Challenges

### Repetitive Task

In this challenge, participants will create agents programmed to automate a sequence of actions over multiple iterations efficiently. The focus lies on optimizing the agent's performance and minimizing execution time while maintaining accuracy.

### One-off Task

The one-off task challenge requires participants to design agents capable of handling unique tasks effectively. Agents must generate plans and execute them proficiently, showcasing adaptability and problem-solving skills.

## How to Participate

1. **Register**: Register for the competition on the designated platform.
2. **Download Data**: Access the datasets and problem statements for both challenges.
3. **Develop Agents**: Utilize LLM methodologies such as Cascaded RL Agents, Planning-guided Transformer Decoding, PEARL Plan and Execute, or React Prompting to develop efficient agents.
4. **Test Performance**: Evaluate the performance of your agents on the provided tasks.
5. **Optimize**: Optimize your agents for speed, accuracy, and resource efficiency.
6. **Submit**: Submit your solutions to the GitHub repository specified for the competition.
7. **Collaborate**: Engage with fellow participants, share insights, and collaborate to enhance agent efficiency.
8. **Winning Criteria**: The fastest and most efficient solutions will be determined based on task completion time and accuracy.
